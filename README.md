# data-science-collaboration
Data science training code and resources. Check out our [wiki](https://github.com/galileia/data-science-collaboration/wiki)

The goal of this project is to share code and resources as we navigate our data science training path. 
We are generally following this [data science](https://github.com/boringPpl/data-science-roadmap) and [data engineering](https://github.com/boringPpl/data-engineer-roadmap) roadmaps and our objective is demonstrate knowledge of the skills illustrated in these roadmaps by working through relevant data science projects. 

Coding language: Python 
Coding tools: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

Data science projects: [data science use cases from databricks](https://databricks.com/p/ebook/the-big-book-of-data-science-use-cases)
